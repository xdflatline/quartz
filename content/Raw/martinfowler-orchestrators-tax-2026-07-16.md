# The Orchestrator's Tax

*Subagents get justified by time saved and parallel execution, but that's not 
 what matters most in long-running multi-agent work. Every token in the orchestrator's 
 context is competing for its attention, and the real value of a subagent is what it keeps 
 out of that context, not how fast it runs. I argue that subagents should be treated as a 
 tool for protecting the orchestrator's working memory, offloading reasoning it doesn't 
 need to hold onto. Doing this well means giving the orchestrator explicit ground rules for
 when and how to delegate. This is exploratory work, built from one real incident, and it ends 
 with more open questions than settled answers.*

I was deep into a Claude Code session on a .NET codebase when a doubt
 interrupted the work. Four subagents were already running against a
 response-pipeline refactor, results were arriving out of order, and the
 session had started to feel harder to reason about than the code itself.

That is usually the moment I stop trusting the vague sense that things
 are “probably fine.” Sometimes the code is the problem. Sometimes the
 architecture is. Occasionally the workflow itself deserves inspection. This
 time I decided it was the workflow.

At first I thought I already knew the question. Were four subagents
 simply too many? That framing felt reasonable. Multi-agent systems are
 usually sold as an obvious productivity win, and if one agent helps, four
 should help more. But every additional agent also consumes tokens, repeats
 some amount of work, and adds another stream of information the orchestrator
 has to reconcile. It looked like a straightforward trade-off between
 parallelism and cost.

I did not want a general argument about multi-agent systems. I wanted an
 answer about that session. So I stopped the coding work and asked the
 orchestrator to critique its own delegation decision, as factually as it
 could.

The answer was not the one I expected. The largest cost in the session
 did not look like it came from running four subagents. It looked like it
 came from the orchestrator itself, specifically from what happened when it
 suggested checking on the other agents.

## The Incident Was Not Really About Parallelism

Four subagents had been launched in one wave. Three had clear runtimes:
 roughly twelve minutes, five and a half minutes, and seven minutes. A fourth
 was still running. Looked at one way, that already justified the delegation.
 Three tasks ran concurrently, so wall-clock time was around twelve minutes
 instead of something closer to twenty-five if the work had been
 serialized.

But speed was the visible byproduct, not the interesting part. What I was
 trying to find was the cost, and my first instinct was that it had to be the
 duplicated effort of delegation itself: every subagent reading files,
 reconstructing context, understanding the task independently.

That was not where the biggest surprise turned up.

At one point during the work, the orchestrator suggested checking on the
 running agents. It was a small, throwaway prompt: “check on the agents.” I
 followed it. Instead of a lightweight summary, the tool it used pulled back
 the full raw transcript of a background agent: tens of thousands of tokens of
 JSONL, intermediate reasoning, and tool output, imported wholesale into the
 main thread. Then it happened again, for a second status check.

There is an important caveat here. The claim that this polling behaviour
 cost more than the duplication tax of four agents was the orchestrator grading
 its own mistake. I didn't have real per-call token accounting, so treat that
 ranking as the orchestrator's account, not a measured fact. The trustworthy
 part is narrower: the transcript dumps were real, the wall-clock timings were
 real, and the status-check path clearly introduced a large, avoidable cost.
 Whether it was the single largest cost remains a hypothesis until the tooling
 can instrument it properly.

What mattered more was that I'd found a cost I hadn't been looking for.

## The Costs Were Not All the Same

Once I stopped treating the session as one lump “subagent cost,” the
 picture broke into pieces that didn't belong together.

First, two of the four subagents were working in the same area of the
 response pipeline. Different tasks, different files, but both had to
 understand the same architecture, the same testing conventions, and much of
 the same surrounding code before either could begin. Each paid that
 orientation cost independently. That's not an argument against delegation.
 It's an argument that the work had been split too finely.

Second, one agent ran `git stash` and `git stash pop` while sibling agents
 were writing elsewhere in the same tree. Nothing broke, but the risk was
 structural, because repository-wide operations are perfectly reasonable in a
 single-threaded session and become much harder to justify the moment multiple
 writers are active at once.

By now I had a growing list of culprits: status polling, duplicated
 orientation, unsafe git operations. I found myself trying to rank them. Which
 one cost the most? The longer I tried to answer that, the less convinced I
 became that ranking them was the right question at all.

## The Scarce Resource Is the Orchestrator's Working Memory

The transcript-polling incident kept bothering me for a reason that had
 nothing to do with token cost. A token bill is one-time, you pay it and it's
 over. What happened here was different. The raw transcript stayed in the
 orchestrator's context after the tool call completed, and every turn after
 that carried it forward, whether or not it was still useful.

That was the moment I realized I had been treating two very different
 kinds of cost as though they were the same. Tokens are spent once. Context
 shapes every decision that follows. I wasn't simply looking at token
 consumption anymore. I was looking at the quality of the orchestrator's
 working memory.

That realization was carrying two separate ideas, and I want to pull them apart
 rather than let them blur together. The first is what I just described.
 Pollution left in context taxes every later turn. The second is not about
 running out of space at all. The more that's sitting in context, competing for
 attention, the harder it gets for a model to pick out what matters right now,
 even with plenty of room still free. A bigger context window doesn't fix that.
 It just gives the noise more room to pile up before anyone notices.

Context windows are only going to get bigger, that's a given. What matters
 is not how much room there is, but how much of what's sitting in that room is
 worth the model's attention. That's the real problem subagents need to solve,
 if they're used right.

Seen this way, the orchestrator is the only part of the system that
 accumulates understanding across a long session. It remembers why a design
 decision was made, carries forward architectural constraints, and knows which
 trade-offs have already been discussed. The subagents don't, and that's by
 design. They are supposed to be disposable. Exploration, repeated file reads,
 failed approaches, and noisy intermediate reasoning are meant to stay in
 worker contexts and never make the trip back to the main thread.

## Cognitive Locality Changes What Parallelism Is For

This reframes the duplicated-orientation problem, which wasn't really “two
 agents reading the same files.” It was two agents independently reconstructing
 the same mental model of the codebase, because the work had been partitioned
 by task rather than by the knowledge each task required. I've started calling
 that distinction **cognitive locality**: Tasks that need the same mental model should usually stay together.
 Splitting them just forces multiple agents to rebuild the same understanding
 from scratch.

Parallelism still matters here, it's just not the main point. Running four
 agents concurrently is useful, but ordinary. The real benefit is that they
 keep noisy intermediate reasoning out of the main thread and return only what
 it still needs. That's the isolation subagents are supposed to provide, and it
 only holds if the main thread respects it.

My working belief now: this is what subagents are actually for. Not that
 they save time, but that they let you offload reasoning the orchestrator
 doesn't need to hold onto, so it has less to carry and less competing for its
 attention. Get the isolation right, keep things local by cognitive locality,
 and subagents become the tool that protects the orchestrator's working memory,
 not just a cost you tolerate for parallelism. That's a belief, though, not a
 measurement. What I've actually measured is the other side of it, the cost of
 getting the isolation wrong.

## Turning a Session into Standing Rules

My next move was the obvious one. Encode the lesson into `CLAUDE.md`, the
 standing instruction file every session loads.

It would have been easy to write a large corrective policy here, but every
 extra line in a standing instruction file is a cost paid again on every future
 session. So I compressed the fix into the smallest set of rules that addressed
 the failures I'd seen. Each one is really answering the same question. Does
 this piece of information, or this way the work is split, earn a place in the
 orchestrator's context?

- Prefer two to four agents in one wave. If the orchestrator wants five or
 more, it should first ask whether tasks sharing files or conventions ought to be
 merged.

- Do not poll background agents for status when the answer can be given
 from what is already known. Do not fetch a full transcript to answer a
 lightweight question.

- Do not allow repository-wide git operations inside concurrent agent
 prompts.

- Treat overlapping file ownership as a consolidation signal, not a cue to
 spawn more agents.

None of these tell the orchestrator exactly what to do in every case. Each
 one gives it something to check or ask itself before acting, not a script to
 run, and none of them is profound on its own. Their only real value is that
 they're all aimed at the same thing, keeping disposable reasoning disposable
 and keeping room in the orchestrator's context for what it needs later in the
 session.

## The Next Mistake Would Have Been More Governance

A later session surfaced a different gap. I had started the orchestrator
 with explicit skills for the kind of work I wanted, coding guidance in one
 case, design guidance in another. I assumed that once a skill was active in
 the main thread, spawned subagents would follow it automatically. They don't.
 A subagent doesn't inherit skills active in the parent session unless the
 orchestrator passes them along explicitly.

My first instinct was to add a confirm-before-spawn gate. The orchestrator
 would stop, list which agents it wants to launch and which skills each should
 load, and wait for my approval.

I'm glad I didn't keep that version. It solved the wrong problem. I didn't
 have evidence that bad spawn plans were slipping through for lack of a
 confirmation step. I'd discovered a missing fact about skill propagation, and
 that's a different kind of gap. A universal confirmation gate would have added
 a round-trip to every similar session, and before long I'd almost certainly
 have started approving those prompts on autopilot.

At that point, I realized I wasn't really improving governance. I was
 just adding another ritual.

And it still wouldn't have caught the real problem from before, the
 orchestrator polluting its own context.

The narrower fix held up better. Before spawning, the orchestrator states
 which active skills are relevant to each agent's task and points the subagent
 at the skill file to load, rather than pasting the whole skill inline.
 Confirmation is only required above the same batch-size threshold already in
 place, or when file ownership is ambiguous.

That left me with a heuristic I now use more than the rule itself: Before
 adding a line to a standing instruction file, ask whether a reasonably
 competent orchestrator would make the right decision once it knew the one
 missing fact.*

If yes, the rule should just state the fact. If the fix starts specifying a
 decision procedure, such as approvals, checkpoints, mandatory steps, that's
 usually a sign I'm encoding process where a small clarification would have
 done the job.

I don't know yet whether that heuristic survives harder cases. For now it
 stops me from turning every interesting incident into a miniature
 bureaucracy.

## Where This Leaves Me

I don't have a settled view of how much governance is enough, and I don't
 think this piece earns one.

What I have instead is a small flywheel, with a human still firmly in the
 middle of it. A session exposes a gap. Someone has to notice that it felt
 wrong, stop the work long enough to inspect it, decide whether the problem is
 real or just noise, and judge what deserves to become a standing rule. The
 orchestrator can grade its own session and surface clues, as it did here, but
 it cannot make that judgment call itself. The choice of what to codify, what
 to leave alone, and what might be an overreaction is still mine. The next
 session then tells me whether that judgment improved the work or just created
 a different kind of waste.

The artifact of this round is the current version of 
 my CLAUDE.md.
 It isn't a finished prescription. It's the state of the calibration after this
 iteration. The thresholds in it, two to four agents per wave, five as a
 consolidation signal, fit the work I was doing when I wrote them. I wouldn't
 present them as anything like universal constants, and I'd be suspicious of
 any orchestration write-up that did. They were also calibrated against Claude Sonnet 5,
 and I haven't tested how they hold up against others. A different 
 model might reasonably need a different balance. A few more rules have accumulated 
 in the file since. Treat this file as a sample, not a template, modify and optimize 
 it for whatever model and workflow you're actually running. What matters isn't the 
 specific file, it's the habit behind it: noticing a failure, asking what it actually 
 cost, and writing the rule that would have caught it. 

For years we optimized software systems around CPU, memory, and throughput.
 The first wave of LLM tooling taught us to watch tokens. This session made me
 suspect there's a third thing worth watching in long-running agent workflows:
 the quality of the orchestrator's own working memory, the one resource that,
 once polluted, keeps charging rent for the rest of the session. I don't think
 that's a settled law yet. It's a pattern that held up in the sessions I've
 looked at so far.

The tax I went looking for was never on the subagents. It was on the
 orchestrator, in what it chose to carry forward. That's the question I carry
 into every multi-agent design now: not how many agents to run, but what earns
 a place in the orchestrator's context.

The questions I'm left with are genuinely open:

- How do I measure this properly, instead of relying on the orchestrator's own
 account of its mistakes?

- When should a missing fact go into the instructions, and when does that turn
 into too much process?

- What's the next orchestration mistake I'm not seeing yet?

I expect I'll revise the file again. That feels less like a failure of
 foresight and more like the normal cost of working with a system opaque enough
 that doubt itself becomes part of the method.

## Related Work

I've written before about context as a scarce resource, from a different
 angle. Context
 Anchoring
 argues that decision context should be externalized into a living document,
 since a conversation forgets its own reasoning as it grows and nothing
 survives the session boundary. That piece is about context surviving across
 sessions. This piece is narrower. It's about keeping context clean within a
 single session, while several agents write to the same working memory at
 once.

## Acknowledgments

The move to turn this incident into a standing CLAUDE.md rule owes
 something to Birgitta Böckeler's Harness
 Engineering,
 which names the loop I was running without having a word for it at the time. A
 feedforward guide (the CLAUDE.md rule) meets a feedback signal (the
 orchestrator's own self-critique, and my review of the session), with a human
 steering the update. That article names three kinds of harness:
 maintainability, architecture fitness, and behaviour. What this piece
 describes, using subagents deliberately to protect what the orchestrator
 carries forward, belongs to a fourth, the orchestration process itself.

Thanks to Martin Fowler for his guidance and feedback throughout, which
 pushed this piece toward clearer thinking and articulation.

 sentence crafting, and paragraph structure wherever it was needed.
